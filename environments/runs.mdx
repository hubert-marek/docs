### Run Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Run">
    Takes a "before" snapshot of the environment state

    ```python
    run = client.start_run(envId=env.environmentId)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Execution">
    Your agent makes API calls that modify the environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compute Diff">
    Compares before/after states to produce a diff

    ```python
    result = client.diff_run(runId=run.runId)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate (Optional)">
    Check if the diff matches expected assertions

    ```python
    evaluation = client.evaluate_run(runId=run.runId)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
