description: "API replicas available in Agent Diff"

## Overview

Agent Diff provides high-fidelity replicas of popular APIs. Each replica:

- **Behaves like the real API** - Same endpoints, same response formats
- **Runs in isolation** - Each test environment has its own data
- **Captures all changes** - Full audit trail via database diff

## Available Services

## Service URLs

When you create an environment, each service gets a unique URL:

```python
env = client.init_env(templateService="slack", templateName="slack_default")

# Service URL format:
# http://localhost:8000/api/env/{env_id}/services/{service}

print(env.environmentUrl)
# Output: http://localhost:8000/api/env/abc123/services/slack
```

## URL Transformation

Code executors automatically transform production URLs:

| Production URL | Agent Diff URL |
|---------------|----------------|
| `https://slack.com/api/*` | `/api/env/{id}/services/slack/*` |
| `https://api.slack.com/api/*` | `/api/env/{id}/services/slack/*` |
| `https://api.linear.app/*` | `/api/env/{id}/services/linear/*` |

## Service Comparison

| Feature | Slack | Linear |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Protocol | REST | GraphQL |
| Authentication | OAuth/API Key (mocked) | API Key (mocked) |
| Real-time | ❌ | ❌ |
| Webhooks | ❌ | ❌ |

## Coming Soon

We're working on adding more services:

- **GitHub** - Issues, PRs, repos
- **Jira** - Issues, projects, workflows
- **Notion** - Pages, databases, blocks
- **Asana** - Tasks, projects, teams

</Note>

## Custom Services

You can add your own service replicas by:

1. Creating a database schema (seed file)
2. Implementing API endpoints that match the real service
3. Registering the service with Agent Diff

See the Slack and Linear implementations for reference:

- `backend/src/services/linear/`
