## Core Concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Templates & Environments" icon="copy" href="/core-concepts/environments">
    Templates are populated database schemas. Environments are isolated, ephemeral copies of templates where your agents operate. **Each environment gets its own base API URL** that you can proxy to your agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runs & Diffs" icon="code-compare" href="/core-concepts/diffs">
    A run represents a single test session within an environment. **Starting a run takes a snapshot, and ending it takes another one and returns a diff** - computed difference between the before and after states of an environment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evaluations" icon="check" href="/core-concepts/diffs">
    Evaluations let you verify that your AI agent performed the expected actions. You can create your own test suites that will **compare expected state change to diff results**, or use our example ones for Linear and Slack.
